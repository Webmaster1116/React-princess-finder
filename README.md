I've borrowed all the Disney Princess dolls from my daughter to build a Machine Learning model such that, an application can recognize them with confidence using a webcam. I have given it a name too. The app is called, `Princess Finder`. 

## Technologies Used

The `Princess Finder` app is built using,
- [The Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/): How about an easy and fast way to create machine learning `models` that you can directly use in your app or site? The Teachable Machine allows you to `train` a computer with images, sounds, and poses. We have created a model using the Disney princess so that, we can perform an `Image Classification` by using it in our app.
- [ml5.js](https://learn.ml5js.org/#/): It is machine learning for the web using your web browser. It uses the web browser's built-in graphics processing unit (GPU) to perform fast calculations. We can use the API like, `imageClassifier(model)`, `classify`, etc. to perform the image classification.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html): It is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. We can use `ml5.js` in a React application just by installing and importing the dependency.

Here is a snap from the app shows, it is 93% confident that the princess is Jasmine. It also marks it with a golden ring.

Whereas, there is no way I look like a Disney Princess(not even a doll). Hence my own image has been classified correctly saying, `No Dolls`.
